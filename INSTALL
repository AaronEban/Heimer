Build & install instructions
============================

These are build & install instructions for Heimer.

Build dependencies
==================

Currently the build depends on Qt5 only (qt5-default, qttools5-dev-tools, qttools-dev packages on Ubuntu).

The "official" build system for Linux is CMake although qmake project files are also provided.

Building in the command line on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04)
==============================================================

Development build (the app can be run without installing anything):
-------------------------------------------------------------------

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

This runs CMake that generates the makefiles for a debug build.

If everything went ok, run:

$ make

This will build the application.

Run Heimer:

$ ./heimer

Run unit tests:

$ ctest

Release build (in this example Heimer installs under /usr):
----------------------------------------------------------

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

If everything went ok, run:

$ make

This will build the application.

Install the binaries and data files:

# make install

This installs also the desktop files so Heimer should appear in your application menu.

Building in Qt Creator
======================

1) Just open the top-level CMakeLists.txt (or heimer.pro)
2) Configure kits and build

Jenkins CI
==========

See `Jenkinsfile` to setup the Jenkins Pipeline.

For Linux packagers
===================

There's an example Debian packaging in packaging/debian/.
